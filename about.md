Welcome to Doomed Collection! I'm a passionate metal dork from India, and I'm excited to share my metal discoveries on this blog. I'm a huge listener of doom metal, and I can't get enough of it. However, my love for metal has no boundaries as I keep exploring all other metal sub-genres, while avoiding some cringe bands.


To be very honest, this ain't a fancy or scholarly thing. It's just a casual space where I write my thoughts, experiences, and anything that excites my metal-loving ass.


Horns up, metalheads ðŸ¤˜
