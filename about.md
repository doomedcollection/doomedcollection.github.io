Welcome to Doomed Collection. Iâ€™m a metalhead, obsessed with the haunting, soul-crushing essence of doom metal but never confined to a single subgenre. 

I embrace it all - from the brain-ripping fury of brutal death metal to the sorrowful, epic weight of doom; from the raw, gloomy chaos of black metal to the triumphant, war-tinged anthems of power metal. 
My passion for metal knows no bounds - if itâ€™s heavy, dark, or intense, itâ€™s fair game, but I try to avoid anything that lacks true spirit like most of the metalcore/deathcore bands.

This isnâ€™t some scholarly endeavor; itâ€™s just a raw, unfiltered space where I share my thoughts, reviews, and discoveries from the deepest, most savage corners of the metal world.

Horns up, metalheads ðŸ¤˜
