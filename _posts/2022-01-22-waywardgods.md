Wayward Gods is an amazing first album that mixes the heavy guitar sounds of Stoner Rock with the dark, ominous feel of Doom Metal, along with themes about magic and the supernatural. It's like going on a wild, spooky journey filled with powerful music.

One of the best songs, "Man As God," proves that Aiwass can make energetic music that appeals to fans of different styles. Another track, "Mythos," has influences from Heavy Psychedelic music and takes you on a trippy ride. Wayward Gods is like the perfect soundtrack for two different adventures: either marching confidently into hell or being pulled into its fiery depths.

The song "Titan" starts with a big, heavy guitar sound that goes on for a while before the drums and bass kick in. It's a strong start to the album and sets the tone for what's to come. The vocals have a mystical, far-off sound that fits well with the music.

"From Chains" has some really impressive guitar parts, especially in the beginning solo. The guitar sounds eerie and hypnotic, and when the heavy riffs kick in, it feels like chaos has arrived. "Man As God" begins with the sound of birds and then dives into another eerie guitar riff. The vocals are pushed back a bit to let the guitars and drums take center stage. "Call of the Siren" starts off with a heavy bass line and wailing guitars that create a spooky atmosphere.

In summary, Wayward Gods by Aiwass is a captivating musical journey that seamlessly blends Stoner Rock, Doom Metal, and occult themes into a compelling experience. From the energetic riffs of "Man As God" to the hypnotic allure of "Call of the Siren," each track offers a unique sonic landscape that keeps listeners engaged. With its mystical vocals, heavy guitars, and haunting atmosphere, Wayward Gods is an album that grabs hold of you and doesn't let go, making it a must-listen for fans of dark and adventurous music alike.
