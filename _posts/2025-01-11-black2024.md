Among the few blasphemous black metal albums I sank into this year, these top 5 releases drowned my soul in darkness.

### 1. Departure Chandelier - Satan Soldier of Fortune

- Personal rating: 9/10
- Genre: Raw Black Metal
- Listen: [Bandcamp](https://departurechandelier.bandcamp.com/album/satan-soldier-of-fortune) / [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/0uucKJBNx2YrtVwbjZN34t?si=NSaiKpABRUOwq4Wk7PJjoA)

I'm a huge fan of this Napoleanic black metal band Departure Chandelier’s debut album in 2019 - "Antichrist Rise to Power". While it stays true to the unpolished, aggressive style of their debut, "Satan Soldier of Fortune" introduces a new level of melody within the rawness, with black metal riffs that strike both ferociously and beautifully. 

The production feels like it was forged in the depths of ancient catacombs, with every note cutting through the air like a dagger. Doom and despair combine seamlessly into the chaos, expanding the album’s sinister atmosphere and giving it an unsettling weight.  The synths, though haunting, never overpower the guitar, instead enhancing the bleak mood and adding depth to the already chilling soundscape.

### 2. Pestilent Hex - Sorceries of Sanguine & Shadow

- Personal rating: 9/10
- Genre: Melodic/Symphonic Black Metal
- Listen: [Bandcamp](https://pestilenthex.bandcamp.com/album/sorceries-of-sanguine-shadow) / [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/1CSCF353U2gpxI1oZFZqGs?si=B5kT9lW2TsSaqG8xlXMuuw)

This grabbed me instantly, with its chilling intro and an album cover with head on plate oozes with dark, macabre energy. There’s something undeniably mystical about Finnish black metal, and this band brings it to life with brutal intensity and an almost ritualistic atmosphere. The music hits hard and never lets up, matching the excellence of their previous work. I’m particularly drawn to the Emperor-like arrangements, where the music feels both grand and ferocious, immersing me in a dark, epic journey. This is black metal at its peak—raw, relentless, and utterly captivating.

### 3. Impious Throne - Suffering

- Personal rating: 8/10
- Genre: Independent Black Metal
- Listen: [Bandcamp](https://impiousthrone.bandcamp.com/album/suffering) / [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/2k9pDoe6U8uqdKcDdciZJq?si=l7NLTnfbQ5eSy7QwUN3JBg)

This has quickly cemented itself as one of favorite black metal albums of the year. The drums are absolutely cosmic in their extremity, blasting with an intensity that feels out of this world. The vocals are cold and unyielding, perfectly complementing the wrathful guitars that tear through the atmosphere with brutal precision. Every track is a masterclass in beautifully constructed aggression, delivering pure, relentless energy. This album is nothing but pure FIRE—no filler, just full-on KILLER from start to finish.

### 4. Amiensus - Reclamation Part I and Part II

- Personal rating: 8/10
- Genre: Progressive Black Metal
- Listen: [Bandcamp](https://amiensus.bandcamp.com/album/reclamation-part-1)

![Amiensus - Reclamation Part I](/img/2024/amrec1.jpg)
![Amiensus - Reclamation Part II](/img/2024/amrec2.jpg)

One of my favorite release of the year comes from the same band with two albums, both released in the same year. Their music is harsh and suffocating, yet strangely beautiful, laced with haunting ambient moments. While Part I delved deep into introspective themes, Part II intensifies the journey, pulling you into a whirlwind of raw emotion and relentless force. The band’s ability to combine progressive elements together with black metal’s ferocity is very impressive, crafting an album that feels both intenseful and beautiful.

### 5. Aquilus - Bellum II

- Personal rating: 7/10
- Genre: Atmospheric Black Metal
- Listen: [Bandcamp](https://aquilus.bandcamp.com/album/bellum-ii) / [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/2EHWybqcELs5r74ETACv1M?si=GKRllMZ7RhKiP-F1nzUMTA)

![Aquilus - Bellum II](/img/2024/bellum2.jpg)

As a huge listener of atmospheric black metal, there’s something incredibly captivating about how it slowly and beautifully seeps into your soul with every listen. Aquilus’ Bellum II is a monumental achievement. The album is vast in both its ambition and its execution, blending guitars, blast beats, harsh vocals, and the unexpected beauty of violins. It doesn’t feel like a traditional album; it flows more like a symphony, with each movement unfolding seamlessly into the next. Bellum II is a testament to how this genre can push boundaries while maintaining its haunting, emotive essence, making it an unforgettable experience.
