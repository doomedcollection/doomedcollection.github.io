I stumbled upon this project through the "Similar artists" section on Spotify. Being a sucker for DSBM (Depressive Suicidal Black Metal), this isn't groundbreaking, but it's a strong EP worth checking out if you're into the genre.

The production of this album is one aspect I enjoy. I like this one more because it's cleaner than many other DSBM artists that use raw noises. If you enjoy late Nocturnal Depression and Dark Funeral, you could enjoy this as well because of the guitar tuning. 

I particularly enjoy the guitar riffs in "Death Addiction," "I Left This Life to Rot," and "Als all Licht meinen Lieb verlie√ü." The drumming is ok, particularly the blast beat that opens "I Left This Life to Rot." Even the traditional introduction is fine because the EP isn't too long and doesn't have any filler tracks. The vocals, which alternate between ominous screams and sorrowful murmurs, perfectly capture the mood of the record.

The only song about which I'm unsure is "Todeslust." The primary riff isn't as appealing, the guitar sounds a little weird, and the vocals are limited to the left channel. However, I don't think it devalues the record.

"Wo Trauer niemals endet" isn't flawless overall, and it may not be the ideal way to introduce DSBM. However, you'll certainly find some tracks to appreciate if you're already a fan of the genre. It's a good album with catchy melodies and a depressing atmosphere. Fans of DSBM should check these out, especially if they're looking for underappreciated bands with quality production.
