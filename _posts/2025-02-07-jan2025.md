Here are my favorite releases that wrecked my soul and kicked off 2025 with pure madness.

### 1. Clouds - Desprins
**Genre:** Atmospheric Doom Metal, Melodic Death-Doom Metal

![Clouds - Desprins](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2060013404_10.jpg)

Flutes with sorrowful growls? That’s Clouds - pure, heartbreaking doom.

We all have that one band we turn to when we’re down - when the everything feels heavy, but music gives us shelter. For me, Clouds is that band. 
Their atmosphere doesn’t just hit hard; it overwhelms and comforts at the same time. A very few bands capture sadness this beautifully.

And Desprins? No drop in quality. From start to finish, it’s drenched in raw emotion, sorrow, and that signature haunting flutes. Another masterpiece for sure.

### 2. Rudra - Antithesis
**Genre:** Vedic Death/Thrash/Black Metal

I'm a massive fan of this Singaporean Vedic metal beast. These guys have been crushing it for decades, blending death, black, and thrash with Sanskrit mantras that hit like ancient war chants. 
Even though I’m an atheist, being a Hindu myself, their music still gives me mad goosebumps every time.

Now, this new album Antithesis - honestly, there’s nothing new. Same style and same mix. 
But does that even matter? Fuck no! The way those mantras and riffs collide is pure destruction. It just works for me always.


### 3. Veil of Conspiracy - Shape of Grief
**Genre:** Funeral Doom Metal

As a huge Swallow the Sun fan, this album hit me instantly. I’ve checked out their previous works earlier, but this album is on next level. 
Every track is drenched in loneliness, despair, and soul-crushing solitude. It’s dark, beautiful, and emotional, while blending death-doom heaviness with haunting progressive elements.

Its not for everyone, But for someone craving for that melancholic and suffocating doom, this album is a masterpiece!


### 4. Pentagram - Lightning in a Bottle
**Genre:** Doom Metal, Heavy Metal

Which doom metal fan doesn’t love Pentagram? These guys are legends! And here we are—10th album, first in a decade.
Honestly, Thought maybe the magic would fade. But no - this is pure classic, vintage doom, straight from the depths of 80s.

The vocals are killer - of course, Bobby is a damn legend. Except for him, the whole lineup is fresh, but they delivered great. The riffs, the groove, the atmosphere - it’s all there. 
Overall, it’s a nostalgic, doomy, and straight-up awesome listen. 

### 5. Bandshee - The Long Road
**Genre:** Stoner Rock & Heavy Psych

I stumbled upon this one by pure chance, and damn, what a trip it was. I already listened to this over 5 times. It's Heavy, trippy, and dripping with that stoner rock fuzz.
The guitars are straight-up killer from start to finish, and the female lead vocalist is absolute magic. Her voice is very pleasant and it pulled me like an ancient spell.

Overall, this is an amazing blend of proggy, folky blues with the perfect dose of heaviness and fuzz. Smooth yet crushing. Definitely a hidden gem!


### 6. Onirophagus - Revelations From the Void
**Genre:** Death Doom Metal

![Onirophagus - Revelations From the Void](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1073928330_10.jpg)

This is some mind fucking stuff. Never checked these guys out before, but damn, I’ve been missing out! They’ve been in the game for a while, but this was my first taste - and what a beast of an album.

Pure 90s death-doom worship with thunderous drums, crushing riffs, and slow, guttural devastation. 
But what really blew my mind are the clean vocals creeping in between the slow, monstrous growls. That contrast hits so damn hard.

### 7. Dragonknight - Legions
**Genre:** Epic Power Metal

![Dragonknight - Legions](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a4181502912_10.jpg)

Normally, I ctopped caring much about new power metal bands. Most modern power metal leans too POP-py. 
But these guys - They’re powerful, epic, and straight-up badass. So glad bands like this are still keeping the flame alive!

The guitar solos are just mesmerizing. The more I listen, the more this album grows on me, some tracks just hit harder with every listen. 
But the real MVP? The keyboards. They add that extra majestic feel that makes the whole thing so damn great.

Hail Power Metal! 

### 8. Weed Demon - The Doom Scroll
**Genre:** Heavy Psych Doom Metal

![Weed Demon - The Doom Scroll](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3620742474_10.jpg)

"Pure Fucking Sludge Doom" - that’s what they claim on their Bandcamp, and for real, they are not wrong.

This is some thick, sludged-out stoner doom that hits slow, heavy, and filthy. The riffs are massive, the vibe is pure doom worship, and that album cover is an absolute killer.

Only complaint? Too short. Just when you’re fully sinking into the swampy riffs, it’s over. Wish it was a bit longer, but still, a solid, crushing release.


### 9. Ethbaal - Absolutely Terrifying Insult
**Genre:** Filthy Sludge Metal?

![Ethbaal - Absolutely Terrifying Insult](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2967198078_10.jpg)

It’s ugly, it’s filthy, and it grinds your ears into the dirt. Another underground filth stuff I stumbled upon through Bandcamp. Sludgy, stoner doom metal at its dirtiest.

Honestly, I have no clue who these guys are. And there’s not much to say, it's just a raw, disgusting listen in the best (or worst) way possible.
